 <h3> ✦ Note :  Our code handles the Bonus question also. </h3>

Through this code we implemented  a peer-to-peer chat program in Python  that enables simultaneous 
sending and receiving messages, supports multiple peers, and allows users to query 
and retrieve the list of peers from which it had received messages. Multiple instances of the code
can be run in seperate terminal environments to form a peer to peer chat network.
